# Notes regarding DeMiSTified versions

**Bugs**

* keyboard controller does not pass diagnostic tests

* With original IBM ROM does not work keyboard (beeps at every keystroke)

  

**Check specific BOARD limitations on each board folder readme.**

For NeptUNO and Deca ports worst case slack is very high. Minor changes in the code mean that the core will likely not work.
